# 📖 How to Brief a New AI Agent

When starting a new chat with an AI agent, simply say:

---

## 🗣️ **What to Say:**

```
Please read the file CURSOR_GALLERY_APP_CONTEXT.md completely to understand the 
Cursor Gallery Android app project. This is a fully functional native Android app 
built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

After reading the context file, I need you to [describe what you want].
```

---

## 💡 **Examples:**

### Example 1: Adding Features

```
Please read CURSOR_GALLERY_APP_CONTEXT.md to understand the project.

After reading, add a theme toggle button to the gallery list screen that 
switches between dark and light mode.
```

### Example 2: Fixing Issues

```
Please read CURSOR_GALLERY_APP_CONTEXT.md to understand the project.

After reading, fix the preview screen so that images don't disappear when 
I drag too fast.
```

### Example 3: Adding New Screens

```
Please read CURSOR_GALLERY_APP_CONTEXT.md to understand the project.

After reading, create a Settings screen with options for theme toggle, 
logout button, and user profile display.
```

## 🎯 **Key Points:**
